# Green-Living

## Project Overview
Throughout my first year of College in Computer Science, I had a Humanities class called Green Living. For the final project, the class was split into teams, and each of them needed to create a campaign or an activity (in which college students can get involved) to encourage sustainability (long-lasting life on people on Earth). Creating a clothing donation, encouraging the use of biodegradable cutlery in the cafeteria, and informing students about special mask disposal guidelines are some of the presented projects. Our team decided to do a Green-Living website which gathered some of the other teams' projects to advertise them. The website was hosted on the college page and allowed students to get a brief idea of the upcoming college events.

## Project Description 
The project is developed using an HTML Template from https://nicepage.com/html-templates?term=green. It advertises seven projects developed by other teams in our class. The website also contains an "About us" page. Each member of our team was responsible for one of the advertised projects. This means that they had to communicate with the other team and make sure that their requirements are met.

<a name="access"></a>
## Access
The website could be accessed via this link: https://mila5847.github.io/Green-Living/greenProject7.html

<a name="features"></a>
## Features
- The website's visitor can view the upcoming activities that will take place at the college.
- The website's visitor can get more information about certain organizations by clicking on images that will bring them to other websites. For example, on the Clothing Donation page, clicking on the image on the right will bring the visitor to the website of the organization to which the donations are going.

<a name="difficulties"></a>
## Difficulties
- The main difficulty was working on the project together without having merge conflicts while working on the same branch. We learned that it was more efficient to work on our own branches before pushing to the main branch. 
- It was sometimes difficult to add a personalized touch to the website because the design was already defined in the template that we used. When we wanted to modify the way a certain part of the website looks, we made sure that the change does not interfere with the other components' design.

<a name="improvements"></a>
## Future Improvements Ideas
- I would like to add a comment/question section on the website so people could ask questions about upcoming events or leave their comments on past events. 
- I would like to add a donation page for clothing donations so people can make the donations online.
